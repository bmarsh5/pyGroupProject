Description:
            From a pile of marbles, a player or the computer may take up to
            half of the marbles on each turn.  The player who takes the last
            marble loses.

            You will note that the computer cannot be beaten in smart mode when it has the
            first move, unless the pile size happens to be 15, 31, or 63. 
            Of course, a human player who has the first turn and knows the winning strategy
            can win against the computer.

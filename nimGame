Description:
            From a pile of marbles, a player or the computer may take up to
            half of the marbles on each turn.  The player who takes the last
            marble loses.

            You will note that the computer cannot be beaten in smart mode when it has the
            first move, unless the pile size happens to be 15, 31, or 63. 
            Of course, a human player who has the first turn and knows the winning strategy
            can win against the computer.

    ''' Smart Mode process '''
# In smart mode the computer takes off enough marbles to make
# the size of the pile a power of two minus 1â€”that is, 3, 7, 15, 31, or 63.
            #### Jim
# That is always a legal move, except when the size of the pile is currently one less than a power of two.
# In that case, the computer makes a random legal move
            #### Kiara

    ''' Stupid Mode process '''
# the computer simply takes a random legal value (between 1 and n/2) from the pile whenever it has a turn
